SIWSL (Sign in with SimpleLogin) Docs
---

Welcome to SIWSL, an [open-source](https://github.com/simple-login/app), privacy-focused login service ðŸŽ‰!

SimpleLogin is designed for privacy-conscious developers like you. Your users have total control over what information they want to share when they sign up for your website with SimpleLogin ðŸ‘‡

Instead of the confusing and over-complicated experiences of **Login with Google/Facebook** docs, SimpleLogin docs is simple and meant to facilitate your life.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to try out SIWSL is via the SimpleLogin SDK.

### Step 1: Create a `index.html` file 

that has a **Sign in with SimpleLogin** button

```html
<button id="btn-simplelogin">
    Sign in with SimpleLogin
</button>

<div id="user-info"></div>

<!-- Include SimpleLogin JS SDK -->
<script src="https://simplelogin.io/sdk/sdk.js"></script>

<script>
// Init SimpleLogin. "quickstart" is the SimpleLogin AppID
SL.init("quickstart");

// Call SL.login when user clicks on the login button
// Upon successful login, you will have access to the user information
document.getElementById("btn-simplelogin").onclick = function(e) {
  SL.login(function(user) {
    console.log("got user from SL SDK", user);

    document.getElementById("user-info").innerHTML = `
    email: ${user.email} <br>
    name: ${user.name} <br>
    avatar: <img src="${user.avatar_url}">
    `
  })
}
</script>
```

### Step 2: Run a local web server

You can use any static server including the Python `http.server` module:

> python3 -m http.server

or NodeJS `http-server` module

> npx http-server -p 8000

Now you should now be able to sign in with SimpleLogin on http://localhost:8000 ðŸŽ‰

## User Info

SIWSL allows you to obtain the following information from a person:

- `email`: either their personal email address or an email alias.

- `name`: their name.

- `avatar_url` (optional): only if this person has decided to share their profile picture. This url **expires** in 1 week.

The next section quickly introduces OAuth2 and what `flow` should be used. If you already have a strong understanding on `OAuth2`, please head directly to [App]({{< relref "/docs/app.md" >}})

## Overview

From the user point of view, the login experience consists of 2 steps:

1. User clicks on **Sign in with SimpleLogin** button and gets redirected to the SimpleLogin authorization page. The user will be asked if they want to share their information with your app/website.

2. User accepts, gets redirected back to your application and are authenticated.

## Flow

From your app's point of view, the flow is the following:

1. User clicks on **Sign in with SimpleLogin**, your app generates a redirection url to SimpleLogin that contains information about your website/app, e.g. `https://app.simplelogin.io/oauth2/authorize?client_id={AppID}&redirect_uri={your_callback_url}`
where `{AppID}` is your SimpleLogin AppId and `{your_callback_url}` is the url that the user will be redirected back in the next step.

2. User approves sharing data with your app, gets redirected back to `{your_callback_url}` along with a special `grant` that allows you to get user information. At this point there are 2 possibilities:

   * the `grant` is an `access token`, in this case it's the `implicit flow`: you can use `access token` to call `user info endpoint` at https://app.simplelogin.io/oauth2/user_info and gets the user info.
   * the `grant` is a `code`, in this case it's the `code flow`: you need an additional step to get the `access token` by calling the `token endpoint` at https://app.simplelogin.io/oauth2/token using `code`. The next step is the same as the previous case where you can get user info using the `access token`.

## Code Flow

If you have access to your back-end (Php, Python, etc), we recommend using `Code Flow` which is more secure: the `code` is transferred using browser redirection but the `access token` is exchanged in a backend-to-backend call.

The url that the user is redirected to after the first step would be `{your_callback_url}?code={code}`

## Implicit Flow

If you don't have access to your back-end or it is difficult to modify back-end code, you should use the `Implicit Flow` where  the `access token` is sent via browser redirection.

The url that the user is redirected to after the first step would be `{your_callback_url}#access_token={access_token}`. Please note that here `#` (fragment) is used instead of `?` (query) to avoid the `access token` from hitting your back-end which should have nothing to do with it.

Please note that the `implicit flow` will probably be replaced soon by the [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-11#section-2.1.1). Support for `PKCE` is on SimpleLogin roadmap. Its use will be transparent in SimpleLogin SDK, meaning that you don't need to change anything.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

SimpleLogin follows the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols, the same standards that power Facebook/Google/Apple/etc login. SimpleLogin is therefore compatible with almost all libraries that support these protocols. The integration typically only requires configuring the right endpoints ðŸ˜‰
