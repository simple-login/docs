# Add SIWSL (Sign in with SimpleLogin) to Discourse
---

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) is a popular open-source forum software.

After adding SIWSL to Discourse, a person can choose to use their SimpleLogin account to log in or sign up on your forum ðŸ‘‡

and they can control which information they want to share:

Adding SIWSL is done in 3 simple steps.

## Step 1: Install the OpenID Connect Authentication Plugin

First, let's install the official OpenID Connect Authentication plugin by adding this line

```
sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-openid-connect.git
```

into your containerâ€™s `app.yml` file (usually present in `/var/discourse/containers/`). More info on how to install a plugin on [How to Install Plugins in Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-plugins-in-discourse/19157)

```
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git
          - sudo -E -u discourse git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-openid-connect.git
```

After that rebuild the container.

```bash
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```

The plugin should be now available on the Discourse Admin/Plugins page

Now go to the **OAuth2 endpoints** page:

- Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** needed for the next step.

- Add `{your forum url}/auth/oidc/callback` as **redirect_uri**, make sure to replace `{your forum url}` by your actual forum URL.
